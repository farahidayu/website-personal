<h1>My experience during MCO</h1>
<p>My name is Farah Idayu binti Mohd Zin. Today i would like to share my experience during MCO. Firsty, throughout the MCO, i was just at home and didn't go anywhere since goverment issued a motion control order(PKP). The goverment is taking steps to reduce the covid-19 outbreak among the people in Malaysia. So, i had to follow the instructions and stay at home with my family.It's so boring but it's good for personal safety. </p>

<h2>My activities</h2


<p>At home, i spent a lot time with my family, watching television, eat and praying together. I not happy because i have to stay at home but i happy because i can make my relationship with my family get more closer. Since i stepped into university, i had less time with my younger brother and my beloved parents.Next, during at home, i had learn how to cooking, and make my skills of cooking is getting better. 
I also trying a new recipes of homemade cakes that i get from google search. This experience is very awesome.</p>

<p>However, due the covid-19 , i had to study online with my friends and lecturers. It's really hard to communicate especially with lecturers because i prefer to study face to face. But its okay because with online class, i can expand my knowledge of cyberspace, the internet and the online applications. It's very useful for me in the future.</p>
